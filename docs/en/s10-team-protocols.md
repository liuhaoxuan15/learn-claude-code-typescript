# s10: Team Protocols

## Problem

In s09, teammates work and communicate but lack structured coordination:

**Shutdown**: Killing a thread leaves files half-written and config.json stale. You need a handshake: the lead requests, the teammate approves (finish and exit) or rejects (keep working).

**Plan approval**: When the lead says "refactor the auth module," the teammate starts immediately. For high-risk changes, the lead should review the plan first.

Both share the same structure: one side sends a request with a unique ID, the other responds referencing that ID.

## Solution

```
Shutdown Protocol            Plan Approval Protocol
==================           ======================

Lead             Teammate    Teammate           Lead
  |                 |           |                 |
  |--shutdown_req-->|           |--plan_req------>|
  | {req_id:"abc"}  |           | {req_id:"xyz"}  |
  |                 |           |                 |
  |<--shutdown_resp-|           |<--plan_resp-----|
  | {req_id:"abc",  |           | {req_id:"xyz",  |
  |  approve:true}  |           |  approve:true}  |

Shared FSM:
  [pending] --approve--> [approved]
  [pending] --reject---> [rejected]

Trackers:
  shutdown_requests = {req_id: {target, status}}
  plan_requests     = {req_id: {from, plan, status}}
```

## How It Works

1. The lead initiates shutdown by generating a request_id and sending through the inbox.

```typescript
const shutdownRequests = new Map<string, { target: string; status: string }>();

function handleShutdownRequest(teammate: string): string {
  const reqId = crypto.randomUUID().slice(0, 8);
  shutdownRequests.set(reqId, { target: teammate, status: "pending" });
  BUS.send("lead", teammate, "Please shut down gracefully.",
    "shutdown_request", { request_id: reqId });
  return `Shutdown request ${reqId} sent (status: pending)`;
}
```

2. The teammate receives the request and responds with approve/reject.

```typescript
if (toolName === "shutdown_response") {
  const reqId = args["request_id"] as string;
  const approve = args["approve"] as boolean;
  const req = shutdownRequests.get(reqId);
  if (req) {
    req.status = approve ? "approved" : "rejected";
  }
  BUS.send(sender, "lead", args.get("reason", "") as string,
    "shutdown_response",
    { request_id: reqId, approve });
}
```

3. Plan approval follows the identical pattern. The teammate submits a plan (generating a request_id), the lead reviews (referencing the same request_id).

```typescript
const planRequests = new Map<string, { from: string; plan: string; status: string }>();

function handlePlanReview(reqId: string, approve: boolean, feedback = ""): string {
  const req = planRequests.get(reqId);
  if (!req) return `Unknown request_id: ${reqId}`;
  req.status = approve ? "approved" : "rejected";
  BUS.send("lead", req.from, feedback,
    "plan_approval_response",
    { request_id: reqId, approve });
  return `Plan ${reqId} ${approve ? "approved" : "rejected"}`;
}
```

One FSM, two applications. The same `pending -> approved | rejected` state machine handles any request-response protocol.

| Component      | Before (s09)     | After (s10)                  |
|----------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| Tools          | 9                | 12 (+shutdown_req/resp +plan)|
| Shutdown       | Natural exit only| Request-response handshake   |
| Plan gating    | None             | Submit/review with approval  |
| Correlation    | None             | request_id per request       |
| FSM            | None             | pending -> approved/rejected |

## Try It

```sh
cd learn-claude-code
npx tsx agents-ts/src/s10.ts
```

1. `Spawn alice as a coder. Then request her shutdown.`
2. `List teammates to see alice's status after shutdown approval`
3. `Spawn bob with a risky refactoring task. Review and reject his plan.`
4. `Spawn charlie, have him submit a plan, then approve it.`
5. Type `/team` to monitor statuses
